# Expanded Implementation Plan & Tasks

## 1. Speed Up API Loading

- Investigate why the current API is slow (30-40s startup). Is it due to serverless cold starts or another issue?
- Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of building a local API or caching data locally for faster access.
- Consider pre-fetching or storing the periodic table data in the app for instant access.

## 2. Improve Feedback (Sounds & Visualizations)

- Add sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.
- Add visual feedback (animations, color flashes, confetti, etc.) for right/wrong answers.
- Consider haptic feedback for mobile.

## 3. More Fluid Stylings (Wordle-like)

- Refine UI/UX to be more fluid and interactive, inspired by Wordle.
- Add smooth transitions, responsive layouts, and engaging color schemes.
- Consider dark/light mode and accessibility improvements.

## 4. Hangman-Style Game Mode

- Implement a new mode where users guess the element name letter by letter (like Hangman).
- Show blanks for each letter, track incorrect guesses, and provide hints.
- Integrate with existing state management and scoring.

## 5. Localized Personal Hiscores

- Store personal best scores for each mode locally (e.g., localStorage).
- Display hiscores on the main menu or after each game.
- Optionally, allow resetting or exporting scores.

## 6. Prevent Repeating Elements in a Game

- Ensure that each element is only presented once per game session, in any mode.
- Track which elements have been used and only reset after all 150 have been played.
- Consider shuffling the element list at the start of each game for randomness.

# MVP

- The basic game with a working API call for elements, buttons to toggle game mode, score count

# Component Breakdown:

# Navbar Component:

- A simple functional component that renders the navigation bar, e.g., game title or links to home/about pages.

# GameMode Component:

- Manages switching between different game modes: typing or multiple choice.
- This could store the selected mode in a state and pass the mode down as props to other components.

# Element Component:

- Responsible for fetching and displaying a random element.
- Use this component to pull from an API (like the periodic table data) and display the element’s atomic number.

# Answer Component:

- Renders either an input field (for typing) or four buttons (for multiple-choice).
- This component can take props like the current game mode (from GameMode) and the correct answer (from Element) to handle user interaction.

# Score Component:

- Displays the user’s score.
- It could be responsible for tracking how many correct/incorrect answers the user has submitted.

# Data Flow and State Management:

## Parent Component (App.tsx):

## Use App.tsx to hold the game state (e.g., element data, user input, game mode, and score). Pass down the relevant state and functions as props to child components.

## Custom Hook (useGameLogic): This hook could encapsulate logic such as fetching random elements, checking answers, and managing the score. It keeps your logic separate from UI code.

By splitting the components this way, you'll maintain cleaner code and separation of concerns. Each component will have a clear responsibility, and state/data can be easily shared via props or context if needed.
